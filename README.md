## User Stories 
- As a visiting user, i would like:
-- To play a quiz regarding Germany
-- To be able to choose a name to play the game and have feedback about my right or wrong answers
-- To have a score counter 
-- To have the possibility to restart the game

## Test Cases
 - As going through Index.html, the user can find the title of the game and two options to click on: "Instructions" and "Start!"
 - If the user chooses to click on the "Instructions" button, the user will see a welcoming title, followed by ten steps to follow about how to play the game. At the end of those instructions, there will be the "Start" button to play the game right away. 
 - When the user clicks the "Start" button, either in the Index.html or at the end of the instructions.html, the user will be linked to the start.html page. Meaning that once there, the user will see the title of the game, a bar to log a name, a "start" button and a score counter. Once the name has been chosen, user should press "start" (that's the only way to start the game, otherwise, the button will not activate the game). Once the user logs the name and hit start, the user will be tested with 10 questions about Germany while having the score number and an inmediate feedback about their answers whether if it's correct or incorrect. After answering the 10 questions, the user will find a final feedback, the number of right questions answered and if they passed or not the test along with a "restart" button to play again. 

##  Deployment

1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tabgit
